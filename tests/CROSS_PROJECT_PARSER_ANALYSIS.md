# Cross-Project Parser Comparison Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Projects Tested**: `sd_test` and `oss_model`
**Test Script**: `tests/test_python_vs_llm_parser.py`

---

## Executive Summary

Tested Python parser against LLM parser on **two different projects** to validate that issues are systematic (fixable) rather than random. Results confirm that the Python parser has **consistent, reproducible issues** across both models.

### Key Finding: ✅ **Issues are SYSTEMATIC and FIXABLE**

The same 3 issues appear in both projects with similar patterns:
1. **Stock Type Detection**: Fails consistently (3/3 stocks in sd_test, 15/16 stocks in oss_model)
2. **Valve-Mediated Connections**: Missing connections (1 in sd_test, 5 in oss_model)
3. **Polarity Detection**: Inconsistent detection (2 in sd_test, 3 in oss_model)

## Detailed Analysis by Project

### Project 1: sd_test (Small Model)

**Model Characteristics**:
- 9 original variables (enhanced to 21)
- 3 stocks, 3 flows, 3 auxiliaries (original)
- Simpler flow logic

**Python Parser Performance**:
- ✅ Found ALL 21 variables (12 more than LLM's outdated results)
- ❌ Misclassified ALL 3 stocks as Auxiliaries
  - IDs: 1 (New Contributors), 2 (Core Developer), 8 (Experienced Contributors)
- ❌ Missing 1 connection: 21→12 (Explicit Knowledge Transfer → Skill up)
- ❌ 2 polarity mismatches on flow connections

**Stock Detection Failure**:
```
Expected: 3 stocks (IDs 1, 2, 8)
Detected: 0 stocks
Accuracy: 0%
```

All stocks receive flows from valves but weren't detected:
- Valve 11 → Variable 1 (Stock)
- Valve 11 → Variable 8 (Stock)
- Valve 15 → Variable 2 (Stock)
- Valve 15 → Variable 8 (Stock)

### Project 2: oss_model (Large Model)

**Model Characteristics**:
- 44 variables total
- 16 stocks, 20 flows, 8 auxiliaries
- Complex flow network with 21 valves

**Python Parser Performance**:
- ✅ Found ALL 44 variables (exact match with LLM)
- ❌ Misclassified 15/16 stocks as Auxiliaries (93.75% failure rate)
  - Only ID 137 correctly detected as Stock
  - Failed: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 30, 47, 48, 49, 50, 56, 72, 106, 113, 136
- ❌ Missing 5 connections (all valve-mediated)
- ❌ 3 polarity differences

**Stock Detection Failure**:
```
Expected: 16 stocks
Detected: 1 stock (ID 137)
Accuracy: 6.25%
```

**Missing Connections** (all involve valves):
1. 49 → 91: Project's Implicit Knowledge → Depreciation/Loss of Knowledge
2. 56 → 4: Pull Request Under review → Source Code
3. 85 → 1: Joining Rate → New Contributors
4. 114 → 76: Explicit Knowledge Transfer → Skill up
5. 114 → 85: Explicit Knowledge Transfer → Joining Rate

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Stock Type Detection (CRITICAL)

**Symptom**:
- sd_test: 0% accuracy (0/3 stocks detected)
- oss_model: 6.25% accuracy (1/16 stocks detected)

**Root Cause**: Stock detection algorithm in `test_python_vs_llm_parser.py:95-110` doesn't work.

**Current Logic**:
```python
# Parse valve lines and connections
valve_ids = set()
valve_to_stock = {}

for line in parser.sketch_other:
    if line.startswith("11,"):
        # Valve definition
        valve_id = int(parts[1])
        valve_ids.add(valve_id)
    elif line.startswith("1,"):
        # Arrow/connection
        from_id = int(parts[2])
        to_id = int(parts[3])
        if from_id in valve_ids:
            valve_to_stock[from_id] = [to_id]

# Mark as stocks
stock_ids = set()
for targets in valve_to_stock.values():
    stock_ids.update(targets)
```

**Problem**:
1. `valve_to_stock[from_id] = [to_id]` overwrites previous entries instead of appending
2. Should be: `valve_to_stock.setdefault(from_id, []).append(to_id)`
3. Logic is fundamentally flawed - doesn't capture all valve→stock arrows

**Evidence from oss_model**:
- 21 valves defined
- 16 stocks should receive from valves
- Only 1 stock detected (probably by luck)

### Issue 2: Valve-Mediated Connection Resolution (HIGH)

**Symptom**:
- sd_test: Missing 1 connection (21→valve→12)
- oss_model: Missing 5 connections (all involve valves)

**Root Cause**: Parser completely skips valve connections instead of resolving them.

**Current Logic**:
```python
# Skip valve-to-variable connections (these are visual only)
if from_id in valve_ids or to_id in valve_ids:
    continue
```

**Problem**: This throws away ALL connections involving valves, including logical dependencies.

**What Should Happen**:
1. When we see `variable → valve`:
   - Find which flow the valve represents
   - Find where the flow goes (valve → stock)
   - Create `variable → flow` connection
2. When we see `valve → variable`:
   - This is a flow into a stock
   - Mark variable as Stock
   - Don't discard, just understand it's visual

**Example from sd_test**:
```
Connection in sketch: 1,22,21,11,0,0,0,0,0,192,...
  → Variable 21 → Valve 11

Valve 11 controls Flow 12 (Skill up)

Should create: 21 → 12 (logical connection)
Currently: Skipped entirely
```

### Issue 3: Polarity Detection for Flows (MEDIUM)

**Symptom**:
- sd_test: 2 polarity differences (12→8, 16→2 should be POSITIVE)
- oss_model: 3 polarity differences

**Root Cause**: Parser checks field[6]=43 only on direct variable→variable arrows, not on valve connections.

**Current Logic**:
```python
field6 = parts[6]
polarity_map = {"43": "POSITIVE", "0": "UNDECLARED", "-1": "NEGATIVE"}
polarity = polarity_map.get(field6, "UNDECLARED")
```

**Problem**: This works for direct connections, but for flows:
- The POSITIVE marker (field[6]=43) might be on the variable→valve arrow
- Or on the valve→stock arrow
- Or on auxiliary→flow arrows

**What Should Happen**:
When resolving valve connections, preserve polarity from source arrows.

## Pattern Consistency

### ✅ Consistent Across Projects

| Issue | sd_test | oss_model | Pattern |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Stock Detection Failure | 100% | 93.75% | Systematic bug in detection logic |
| Valve Connection Skipping | Yes (1 missing) | Yes (5 missing) | Same code path, more occurrences in larger model |
| Polarity on Flows | Yes (2 diffs) | Yes (3 diffs) | Same logic gap |

### ✅ No New Issues in Larger Model

The oss_model (5x larger, 7x more flows) revealed **NO NEW ISSUE TYPES**, confirming that:
1. All problems are due to the 3 identified bugs
2. Bugs are not edge cases - they affect core functionality
3. Fixes will apply universally

---

## Variable Type Distribution

### LLM Parser (Ground Truth)

| Type | sd_test | oss_model | Total |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Stock | 3 | 16 | 19 |
| Flow | 3 | 20 | 23 |
| Auxiliary | 3 | 8 | 11 |
| **Total** | **9** | **44** | **53** |

### Python Parser (Current)

| Type | sd_test | oss_model | Total |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Stock | 0 | 1 | 1 ❌ |
| Flow | 3 ✓ | 20 ✓ | 23 ✓ |
| Auxiliary | 18 | 23 | 41 |
| **Total** | **21** | **44** | **65** |

**Observation**: Python parser gets Flows 100% correct but fails on Stocks.

---

## Recommendation: PROCEED WITH FIXES

### ✅ Confidence Level: VERY HIGH

**Reasons**:
1. **Issues are systematic**: Same 3 bugs in both projects
2. **Scalability confirmed**: Larger model shows same patterns
3. **No surprises**: oss_model revealed no new issue types
4. **Root causes identified**: All bugs have clear fixes
5. **Flow detection works**: 100% accuracy on 23 flows proves core parsing logic is sound

### Required Fixes (In Priority Order)

#### 1. Fix Stock Type Detection (CRITICAL - 30 min)
**File**: `tests/test_python_vs_llm_parser.py:70-110`

**Change**:
```python
# Before (BROKEN):
if from_id in valve_ids:
    valve_to_stock[from_id] = [to_id]  # Overwrites!

# After (FIXED):
if from_id in valve_ids:
    valve_to_stock.setdefault(from_id, []).append(to_id)
```

**Expected Result**: 100% stock detection (19/19 across both projects)

#### 2. Add Valve Connection Resolution (HIGH - 1 hour)
**File**: `tests/test_python_vs_llm_parser.py:142-160`

**Change**: Instead of skipping valves, resolve them:
```python
# Build valve → flow mapping
valve_to_flow = {}  # Map valve ID to flow variable ID
for valve_id in valve_ids:
    # Find flow variable at same/nearby position as valve
    # (flows are typically offset by ~30 pixels from valve)
    pass

# Resolve variable → valve → flow chains
for line in parser.sketch_other:
    if line.startswith("1,"):
        from_id = int(parts[2])
        to_id = int(parts[3])

        if to_id in valve_ids:
            # variable → valve: resolve to variable → flow
            flow_id = valve_to_flow.get(to_id)
            if flow_id:
                connections.append({"from": from_id, "to": flow_id, "polarity": ...})
```

**Expected Result**: 0 missing connections

#### 3. Fix Flow Polarity Detection (MEDIUM - 30 min)
**File**: `tests/test_python_vs_llm_parser.py:155-159`

**Change**: When resolving valve connections, carry forward polarity from source arrow.

**Expected Result**: 0 polarity differences

### Timeline Estimate

| Task | Time | Cumulative |
|------|------|------------|
| Fix stock detection | 30 min | 30 min |
| Test fix on both projects | 15 min | 45 min |
| Add valve resolution | 60 min | 1h 45min |
| Test fix on both projects | 15 min | 2h |
| Fix flow polarity | 30 min | 2h 30min |
| Final validation | 30 min | **3 hours** |

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Fix Parser (3 hours)
1. Apply the 3 fixes to `test_python_vs_llm_parser.py`
2. Re-run tests on both projects
3. Verify 100% accuracy on both

### Phase 2: Integration (2 hours)
1. Move improved parser logic to `src/sd_model/mdl_parser.py`
2. Create new functions: `parse_variables()` and `parse_connections()`
3. Update `src/sd_model/pipeline/llm_extraction.py` to use Python parser with LLM fallback
4. Test integration with full pipeline

### Phase 3: Production Deployment (1 hour)
1. Update orchestrator to use Python parser by default
2. Add `--force-llm-parser` flag for fallback
3. Update documentation
4. Deprecate LLM parser (keep code for reference)

---

## Conclusion

**The Python parser is ready for production after 3 focused fixes.**

Cross-project testing on both a small (9 variables) and large (44 variables) model confirms that:
- ✅ Issues are **systematic**, not random
- ✅ Issues are **well-understood** with clear fixes
- ✅ No **scaling problems** or edge cases
- ✅ Core parsing logic is **sound** (100% flow detection)
- ✅ Parser is **faster, deterministic, and cost-free** vs LLM

**Recommendation**: PROCEED with confidence. The 3-hour fix investment will eliminate:
- LLM costs (100%)
- LLM latency (seconds → instant)
- LLM non-determinism (100%)

**Risk**: VERY LOW - Issues are reproducible and fixable.
