add a review section in the loop weher the generated feedback by the llm considers the rview(which might be your additinal text that want to be considered)

add UI for easier analysis

Are the loops only between two variables? what if we have loops taht are 
betweeen more than one variable? Can I denote that in the diagram if necessary? or add a comment somewehre about it or sth


new, adjacent theory recommendation -> this will be based on my reserach question, what could matter as a result of AI


eventually this will become aware of the knowledge from the other project but not yet.

You need an early UI to be able to validate what you get quickly and be able to move forward faster.

Restructuration prompt needed: the project can get significant improvement in implementation and functionality but chatgpt couldn't quite do it, I need a better prompt for the structure

is there a GPT.md? this is not doing waht I want it to and is incredibly slow
