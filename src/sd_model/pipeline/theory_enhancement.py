# Your Task

Analyze the model and theories to identify:
1. **Missing theory elements** - Key concepts from the theories not yet modeled
2. **Underutilized aspects** - Parts of theories only partially implemented
3. **SD implementation suggestions** - Specific variables, connections, and loops to add

For each missing theory element, provide:

1. **What to add** (variables, connections)
2. **Why it's important** (theoretical justification)
3. **How to implement** (step-by-step SD modeling)
4. **Expected impact** (what dynamics this will capture)
