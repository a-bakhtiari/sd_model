# Enterprise AI Transformation Research Project

## Project Purpose
PhD dissertation on organizational transformation driven by AI adoption in established enterprises.

## Research Focus
Understanding HOW enterprises navigate AI transformation through a process-oriented system dynamics model that captures:
- Organizational mechanisms determining success/failure at each transformation stage
- Strategic decision-making patterns (governance, investment, scope)
- Technical implementation dynamics (infrastructure, applications, integration)
- Organizational adaptation processes (skills, roles, culture, resistance)
- Value capture patterns (productivity, innovation, competitive advantage)

## Career Positioning Strategy
This dissertation is designed to build expertise for post-graduation career as:

### Primary Role: Strategic AI Transformation Consultant/Advisor
- Help executives understand where/how to deploy AI
- Guide organizational redesign and transformation processes
- Provide diagnostic frameworks and intervention strategies

### Secondary Role: Technical AI Implementer
- Build and architect AI applications for enterprises
- Bridge strategy and technical implementation

## Target Organizations
- **Primary**: Large enterprises (Fortune 500) undergoing AI transformation
- **Secondary**: Mid-size companies in growth phase, scaling with AI
- **Domain**: Software/tech industry initially (leveraging OSS expertise), with generalizable frameworks

## Theoretical Approach
- **Balance**: Theory-heavy (PhD rigor) with practical applicability
- **Foundation**: Process theory, institutional theory, organizational change theories
- **Method**: System dynamics modeling to capture temporal evolution and feedback dynamics
- **Contribution**: Novel process theory of enterprise AI transformation

## Empirical Strategy
- **Initial Focus**: AI adoption for software development in tech enterprises
  - Leverage OSS ecosystem data and domain expertise
  - Interview CTOs, AI leads, transformation executives
  - 3-5 case studies at different transformation stages
- **Generalization**: Design theory to extend beyond software to other knowledge work domains

## Timeline
- **Duration**: 2-3 years full-time PhD work
- **Deliverables**:
  - 9-chapter dissertation
  - Academic papers (theory, methodology, empirics)
  - Practitioner framework (diagnostic tool + intervention playbook)

## Differentiation from OSS Project
This project is fundamentally different from the OSS developer skill progression model:
- **Unit of analysis**: Organizations (not individuals)
- **Question**: How do organizations transform? (not how do developers learn?)
- **Theories**: Institutional + process + strategic change (not apprenticeship + communities of practice)
- **Context**: Enterprise organizations (not open source communities)
- **Dynamics**: Strategic decisions, governance, resource allocation (not skill development and mentoring)

## Skills Development Goals
Using this dissertation to develop capabilities currently lacking but needed for career success:

**Current Strengths:**
- System thinking and SD modeling
- AI/programming technical skills
- OSS domain expertise

**Strategic Skill Gaps to Build:**
- Enterprise decision-making and transformation processes
- Organizational change and redesign expertise
- Strategic frameworks for AI deployment
- Consulting and advisory capabilities
- Understanding how large organizations actually make and implement strategic technology decisions

## Key Questions Under Exploration
1. What stages do enterprises progress through in AI transformation?
2. What organizational mechanisms enable/hinder progression between stages?
3. How do strategic decisions, technical implementation, organizational adaptation, and value capture interact dynamically?
4. What intervention strategies work at each stage?
5. What patterns/archetypes exist across different transformation journeys?
