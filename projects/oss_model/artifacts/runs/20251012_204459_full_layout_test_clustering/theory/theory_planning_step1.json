The SECI knowledge spiral operates as contributors socialize, externalize, combine, and internalize knowledge. Skill development occurs through legitimate peripheral participation, moving contributors from periphery to core.

    "overall_narrative": "The open source ecosystem flows through interconnected processes that create virtuous cycles of growth and development. Community Attraction and Onboarding brings new talent into the system [overlap: Process 1\u21922], feeding the Knowledge Development and Skill Building process where contributors gain capabilities. Skilled contributors then flow into Contribution and Code Development [overlap: Process 2\u21923], creating value through code contributions. The resulting product improvements feed Product Evolution and User Adoption [overlap: Process 3\u21925], which generates success signals that enhance Reputation and Ecosystem Growth [overlap: Process 5\u21926]. Strong reputation then feeds back to attract more talent [feedback loop: Process 6\u21921], completing the primary growth cycle. Simultaneously, Community Health and Retention [Process 4] provides stabilizing forces, receiving engaged contributors from skill building [connection: Process 2\u21924] and feeding retained expertise back into contribution activities [feedback: Process 4\u21923]. Knowledge flows bidirectionally throughout, with transactive memory systems and SECI processes connecting all stages. The system maintains adaptability through feedback mechanisms where product evolution signals influence contribution priorities [connection: Process 5\u21923] and community health indicators affect attraction strategies [connection: Process 4\u21921]."
