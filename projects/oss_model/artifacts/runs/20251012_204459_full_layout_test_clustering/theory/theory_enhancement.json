The resulting product improvements feed Product Evolution and User Adoption [overlap: Process 3\u21925], which generates success signals that enhance Reputation and Ecosystem Growth [overlap: Process 5\u21926]. Strong reputation then feeds back to attract more talent [feedback loop: Process 6\u21921], completing the primary growth cycle. Simultaneously, Community Health and Retention [Process 4] provides stabilizing forces, receiving engaged contributors from skill building [connection: Process 2\u21924] and feeding retained expertise back into contribution activities [feedback: Process 4\u21923]. Knowledge flows bidirectionally throughout, with transactive memory systems and SECI processes connecting all stages.
