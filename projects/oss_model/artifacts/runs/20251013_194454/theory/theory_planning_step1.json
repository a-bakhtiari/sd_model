Rates and speeds: Attraction into observing occurs at a rate driven by external signals (stars, social media, badges) and word-of-mouth; conversion from observer to first-time contributor occurs at a pace limited by onboarding clarity and mentor availability; movement from peripheral to regular contributor accelerates with repeat interactions and timely review turnaround. Feedback loops: Reinforcing\u2014visible newcomer success (fast merges, thanks in release notes) increases attraction, which raises the count of first-time contributors and the likelihood of further visible successes; Balancing\u2014if review capacity is exceeded, first-response time lengthens, discouraging newcomers and lowering conversion. Time delays: It typically takes 2\u20136 weeks for a newcomer to complete a first contribution, and 3\u20136 months of intermittent activity to be recognized as a regular; recognition and trust often require 5\u201310 positive interactions, creating a threshold effect. Nonlinearities: Progress towards regular status jumps after several reciprocated interactions (e.g., >5 reviews responded to); acceptance probability saturates when mentor-to-newcomer ratios exceed about 1:8; missing or ambiguous governance (CLA, code of conduct) creates stepwise drop-offs at the gate. Causal relationships: Conversion rate is limited by available mentors and the clarity of contribution rules; first-PR acceptance likelihood increases with task scoping (good-first-issue density) and task-technology fit for the tools used; social capital (bridging ties to insiders) and credible signals (prior OSS track record) raise the rate of moving from periphery to regular contributor.",

Their work enters the contribution pipeline, where routines, tooling fit, and reviewer capacity determine throughput, quality, and cycle time (Contribution Throughput and Quality Control Pipeline). Governance allocates decision rights, sets policies and quality gates, and promotes trusted contributors to reviewer/maintainer roles, periodically adjusting structures in response to performance and crises (Governance, Decision Rights, and Role Transitions). Motivation and workload dynamics determine whether contributors persist toward core status or exit; recognition and resources reinforce engagement, while overload and long response times accelerate burnout (Motivation, Workload, and Retention Dynamics). These processes form interlocked feedback: effective governance and routines accelerate throughput and recognition, which fosters motivation and knowledge growth, increasing the pool of candidates for governance roles. Conversely, when reviewer capacity is outpaced, delays depress newcomer conversion and motivation, build backlog, and trigger governance interventions (e.g., role expansions, policy changes). Cross-scale constraints (ecosystem/foundation) and punctuated events create step changes in governance and workload, shaping the trajectory from peripheral to core developer over 6\u201318 months for typical cases, with thresholds in reputation, trust, and capacity acting as gates along the path."
