        "narrative": "A stock of Prospective Observers accumulates as developers become aware of the project through search, social mentions, and ecosystem channels. Their inflow is driven by project visibility, endorsements, and perceived legitimacy; their outflow is churn back to the general developer pool when interest fades. A conversion flow moves Prospective Observers into Engaged Newcomers when perceived benefits outweigh perceived costs. Benefits are signaled by stars, badges, release stability, and responsive governance; costs are estimated onboarding time, uncertainty about norms, and expected review latency. Conversion accelerates when the project\u2019s signals are credible (Signaling Theory) and when newcomers see peers like themselves participating (Communities of Practice identity cues, SCCT outcome expectations and self-efficacy). Diversity of entry points (documentation, design, localization, triage) increases the probability that at least one pathway fits a newcomer\u2019s skills and preferences, increasing conversion elasticity (Diversity Trumps Ability). Diffusion of Innovations governs the movement from awareness to interest; early adopters\u2019 endorsements propagate through networks, with a 2\u20138 week delay before visible surges. A reinforcing loop operates as Engaged Newcomers produce social proof (issues, discussions), which raises perceived legitimacy and boosts future inflow. A balancing loop emerges when anticipated response time exceeds a tacit threshold (e.g., PRs sit >7\u201310 days), depressing conversion. Nonlinearity appears as a social-proof threshold: below visible sustained activity, conversion remains low; once activity crosses a perceptual threshold, conversion rises sharply. Time-to-conversion typically ranges from days to a few weeks; spikes occur after major releases or positive press with a 1\u20132 week lag.",

They transition to Peripheral Participants by taking low-risk, legitimate tasks (e.g., clarifying docs, tagging issues) at a rate limited by access to legitimate opportunities and socialization bandwidth. Legitimate Peripheral Participation explains that newcomers learn norms and practice by participating at the edge, with practice-based identity building as they observe and mimic. Communities of Practice dynamics provide a reinforcing loop: as Peripheral Participants grow, more peer help and examples become available, which lowers the perceived risk of first actions and increases progression speed. However, mentoring capacity and clarity of contribution rules create a balancing loop. When the volume of Engaged Newcomers exceeds available response bandwidth, questions go unanswered, increasing time-to-first-response; progression slows and some revert to inactivity. SCCT mechanisms operate as successful micro-actions (merged typo fixes, answered questions) raise self-efficacy, increasing the hazard rate of transitioning to more complex tasks. Task-technology friction (setup pain, unclear issue templates) shows up as nonlinearity: below a minimum effective documentation clarity (e.g., up-to-date setup scripts), progression is very slow; above it, transition rates increase sharply. Delays of 1\u20134 weeks are typical between initial engagement and first peripheral acts; seasonal effects arise around major releases. Adaptive social norms and mentoring behaviors are appropriated and reinforced over time, with drift toward inclusivity when feedback loops highlight that gentle guidance increases retention.",

They advance to Active PR Submitters via a First-PR rate determined by task-technology fit, review capacity, and clarity of processes. Task-Technology Fit governs productivity: if local environment setup, CI, and linters align well with the newcomer\u2019s OS, language version, and IDE, the cycle time to first working change shortens; poor fit creates friction and abandonment. SECI processes translate tacit heuristics embedded in templates and exemplars into explicit steps (externalization), which newcomers then recombine to craft their first contributions (combination). Adaptive Structuration Theory explains how contributors appropriate tooling (issue templates, PR bots) and rules (style checks) as resources to accomplish tasks; consistent appropriation reduces variance in PR quality, increasing acceptance probability. A reinforcing loop occurs when the stock of accepted first contributions grows: newcomers see a shorter and more predictable review queue, which boosts attempt rates. A balancing loop is the review backlog: if PR queue length or time-to-first-review exceeds a threshold (e.g., >5 business days), first-PR attempts slow, and abandonment increases. Nonlinearities arise at two thresholds: setup friction (below which virtually no first PRs complete) and review latency (beyond which abandonment accelerates). Typical delays include 1\u20133 days for environment setup and 1\u20132 weeks from submission to merge.

Absorptive Capacity governs this transition: prior related knowledge (language, framework) and the frequency of meaningful interactions with the code and reviewers jointly determine the learning rate. SECI processes continue as tacit reviewer heuristics are internalized through repeated feedback, and contributors begin to combine multiple modules\u2019 practices to produce more integrated changes. Transactive Memory Systems emerge as contributors learn who knows what and how to route questions; this reduces search costs and increases effective problem-solving capacity. A reinforcing learning curve operates: as competence increases, cycle time drops, enabling more contribution episodes per unit time, which further deepens architectural understanding. A balancing loop arises from codebase complexity and volatility; as the project adopts new paradigms or refactors, the gap between current mental models and code reality widens, temporarily slowing progression. Skill-Biased Technical Change can raise the bar for competence when the project adopts more sophisticated tooling or languages, stretching time to competence for some. Typical delays are 3\u20139 months from first PR to stable competence, with nonlinear acceleration after crossing a threshold of roughly several dozen contributions or successful reviews in diverse modules.

    "overall_narrative": "The model traces a pipeline of people moving from Prospective Observers to Engaged Newcomers, Peripheral Participants, Active PR Submitters, Competent Contributors, Recognized Contributors, Maintainer Candidates, Maintainers, and Sustainable Maintainers. Each process is a SISO mini-system that transforms one stock into the next at rates shaped by learnable routines, social signals, governance rules, and resource constraints. Multiple cross-process feedbacks weave these modules into a dynamic architecture: sustainable maintainers increase review throughput and mentoring, speeding both first-PR completion and peripheral socialization; governance capacity and release cadence amplify project reputation, which increases attraction at the front of the pipeline; routine clarity and automation lower friction for onboarding; selection criteria coevolve with project complexity, modulating the gate from candidacy to maintainership. Dominant system archetypes include Limits to Growth (inflow growth constrained by review and governance capacity), Success to the Successful (recognized contributors gain visibility that accelerates promotion), Growth and Underinvestment (demand growth outpacing automation and governance investment), and Balancing with Delay (burnout and recovery lags shaping maintainer retention). Nonlinear thresholds\u2014social proof for attraction, setup friction for first PRs, trust for recognition, and burnout tipping points\u2014produce phase shifts and punctuations in trajectory. Governance is explicit in three places: role expansion into governance work, maintainer selection and gatekeeping, and the governance capacity module that transforms maintainer time into legitimate decisions and reliable releases. Panarchy and coevolution connect the project to the broader OSS ecosystem, enabling simulation of shocks (e.g., security incidents, upstream changes) and governance reforms. The structure is ready to be parameterized with observed rates (e.g., PR latency, release cadence, attrition) to test policies such as adding automation, diversifying entry pathways, adjusting selection criteria, or investing in mentoring to accelerate movement from periphery to core while sustaining governance quality."
