They transition into Aware Prospects at a conversion rate driven by social exposure and project signaling. Conversion accelerates with higher visibility capital (stars, mentions, endorsements) and the density of bridging ties in the broader ecosystem. As more Aware Prospects exist, they create word-of-mouth exposures that further increase contact with the Unaware pool, a reinforcing diffusion loop. However, as the Unaware pool shrinks, conversion naturally slows (saturation). A fraction of Aware Prospects forgets or loses interest, leaking to a boundary sink (awareness decay) over weeks. There is a nonlinearity: once visibility crosses platform-specific trending thresholds, conversion spikes, but above a high exposure level, message fatigue reduces marginal conversion (diminishing returns). Average exposure-to-awareness delay is on the order of 1\u20134 weeks due to content discovery cycles. Alumni advocates and sponsors inject high-credibility signals that raise the effective contact rate and reduce perceived risk. Governance reputation (predictability of norms, clarity of rules) also improves signal quality with a delay, making exposure more convincing. Overall, this process transforms a diffuse external population into an informed candidate pool through diffusion dynamics, moderated by structural network position, signaling strength, and platform algorithm thresholds, and constrained by saturation and attention decay.\",\n        \"theories_used\": [\"Diffusion of Innovations\", \"Signaling Theory\", \"Social Capital and Structural Holes\", \"Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity\"],\n        \"additional_theories_used\": [],\n        \"connections_to_other_clusters\": [\n          {\n            \"target_cluster\": \"Entry and Legitimate Onboarding\",\n            \"connection_type\": \"feeds_into\",\n            \"description\": \"Aware Prospects flow into Newcomer Observers via the enrollment rate.\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"target_cluster\": \"Alumni Advocacy and Ecosystem Diffusion\",\n            \"connection_type\": \"receives_from\",\n            \"description\": \"Advocates increase the awareness conversion coefficient through credible word-of-mouth.\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Entry and Legitimate Onboarding\",\n        \"narrative\": \"The stock of Aware Prospects feeds the stock of Newcomer Observers when individuals decide to join channels, subscribe, or take a first onboarding step (e.g., setting up the toolchain). The entry rate depends on legitimate peripheral participation: newcomers must see low-risk, sanctioned ways to hang around the periphery. Self-efficacy and outcome expectations (SCCT) amplify entry when success looks attainable (clear good-first-issues, responsive forums) and valued (recognition, learning). Task-Technology Fit moderates the friction; if the project\u2019s toolchain and issue templates match prospect skills and platforms, conversion rises. Governance policies (code of conduct, contribution guidelines) signal psychological safety and procedural clarity; when clear and enforced, they increase the perceived resource side of the JD-R balance (support, predictability) and reduce perceived demands (ambiguity, fear of rejection). A balancing loop arises from onboarding capacity: as Newcomers accumulate, questions and configuration problems accumulate; if response time lengthens beyond 24\u201348 hours, perceived support drops and entry slows. A reinforcing loop occurs when Newcomers themselves answer each other and generate social proof, easing subsequent entry. Time delays arise from setup cycles (1\u20132 weeks) and first response times (hours to days). Nonlinear thresholds matter: below a critical mass of clearly labeled beginner tasks or when first response exceeds ~48 hours, conversion falls sharply; above these thresholds, conversion accelerates. A leakage flow from Aware Prospects exits to a sink (lost interest) when friction is high or signals are weak.

The progression rate is a function of absorptive capacity (prior related knowledge and learning ability) interacting with knowledge made available through SECI cycles: socialization in chat (tacit-to-tacit), externalization in issue/PR templates (tacit-to-explicit), combination via documentation and examples (explicit-to-explicit), and internalization through hands-on practice (explicit-to-tacit). Dynamic knowledge creation unfolds as newcomers reflect on feedback and iterate; each accepted micro-contribution seeds more explicit examples that ease later transitions, a reinforcing loop. Task-Technology Fit influences first-PR success probability\u2014tooling friction or unfamiliar languages reduce fit. Skill-biased technical change raises the minimum skill needed as the codebase modernizes; if the complexity growth outpaces documentation and mentoring, the progression rate falls, a balancing loop. JD-R operates at the individual level: supportive feedback, clear labels, and mentor availability are resources; long review delays and unclear tests are demands. When demands exceed resources, dropout to a sink accelerates. Review and mentoring capacity are constrained by active maintainers and regular contributors; when capacity is tight, first response and cycle time stretch (1\u20136 weeks), depressing first-PR throughput. There is a threshold nonlinearity: once newcomers accumulate about 10\u201315 meaningful interactions, self-efficacy rises steeply and first-PR success becomes much more likely. Release transitions (API changes) temporarily invalidate examples, lowering effective absorptive capacity with a several-week delay.

However, stability in routines can become inertia; changes to coding standards or CI pipelines initially slow acceptance, a balancing loop that weakens as routines are re-learned. Release freezes and large refactors produce punctuated equilibria\u2014temporary shocks that reduce acceptance windows and elevate quality thresholds. JD-R continues to shape persistence: supportive code review, clear style guides, and automated tests are resources; large backlogs and repeated rejections are demands. Task-Technology Fit between contributor skills and available tasks moderates acceptance probability. Diversity improves collective problem solving and code review quality up to a coordination threshold; beyond it, communication overhead grows nonlinearly, reducing throughput unless norms and tooling adapt. Time delays of several days to weeks in review create oscillations: surges of incoming PRs inflate the queue; slow feedback triggers attrition; reduced inflow allows queues to shrink, after which inflow rebounds.
