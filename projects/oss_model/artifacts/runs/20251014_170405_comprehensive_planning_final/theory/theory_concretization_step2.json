This pool increases at a rate proportional to external visibility and social proof, with a delay of 1\u20133 months as signals propagate and reputations consolidate. Candidates convert to the periphery when the perceived task-technology fit seems achievable and self-efficacy is high; conversion speed accelerates with clear \u201cgood first issue\u201d signals, welcoming documentation, and quick response expectations. A reinforcing loop amplifies attraction: visible success and recognized leaders boost social proof, increasing inflow, which leads to more contributions that further strengthen external signals. A balancing loop tempers conversion when onboarding capacity is tight\u2014if first-response latency to newcomers\u2019 inquiries or PRs rises beyond a threshold (e.g., 7\u201310 days), negative word-of-mouth dampens the consideration inflow after a lag. Diversity-promoting cues (inclusive language, codes of conduct) widen the reachable audience and raise conversion for underrepresented groups, creating nonlinearity: below a visibility threshold, conversion remains low; above it, conversion accelerates sharply. The stock drains to the periphery through an enrollment flow and to an external sink via drop-off when expected costs exceed perceived benefits. Governance transparency (clear contribution rules, code ownership maps) lowers uncertainty, nudging a higher fraction into the periphery. The process transforms diffuse attention into actual peripheral participation, constrained by credibility, capacity, and perceived fit, with delays and thresholds that can create surges or droughts in newcomer entry.",

        "narrative": "A cohort of peripheral participants accumulates as newcomers arrive, observe work practices, and try small, low-risk tasks. Progression to engaged newcomers occurs as individuals achieve legitimate peripheral participation through observation, shadowing, and micro-contributions. The advancement rate rises with the availability of micro-tasks, accessible communication channels, and timely feedback from mentors. A reinforcing loop emerges: as more engaged newcomers succeed, they model behavior for others, increase peer assistance, and create micro-documentation, which makes additional progression easier. A balancing loop sets in when the mentor-to-newcomer ratio falls below a viable threshold (e.g., 1:5\u20131:10): response quality and psychological safety erode, increasing peripheral attrition to the sink and reducing progression. The balance between job demands and resources shapes persistence; higher complexity and ambiguous norms increase demands, while clear templates, warm triage, and responsive reviews boost resources. Delays are prominent: it typically takes 2\u20138 weeks for a newcomer to move from passive observation to regular small contributions, and feedback delays compound when review queues lengthen. Nonlinearities appear around attention bottlenecks: once the queue of unreviewed contributions exceeds a moderate limit (e.g., 20 items), perceived neglect rises sharply, doubling attrition. Governance artifacts (codes of conduct, contributing guides, triage policies) shape legitimate participation by clarifying expectations and sanctions, reducing uncertainty and accelerating transition. The process transforms peripheral participants into engaged newcomers, limited by mentoring capacity and attention dynamics, with strong sensitivity to queueing delays and psychosocial supports.",

A counteracting loop arises from codebase complexity: as architectural intricacy and implicit conventions grow, the marginal effort to understand dependencies increases, slowing internalization.

The transition to productive contributors depends on task-technology fit: when issues match skill profiles and CI/CD, linters, and review tools are appropriated effectively, throughput per person increases. Adaptive structuration explains how contributors appropriate tools and rules-in-use; positive appropriation (e.g., pre-commit hooks, test scaffolds) reduces cognitive load, shortens cycle time, and stabilizes quality. A reinforcing loop develops when improved tooling reduces build/test friction, freeing time to invest back into further automation. A balancing loop appears with skill-biased technical change: if the toolchain modernizes (e.g., containerized builds, complex monorepos) faster than user upskilling, contributors without prior exposure slow down or stall, lowering progression rates. Nonlinear learning curves are common: below a threshold of successful end-to-end build cycles (e.g., 5\u201310), confidence and velocity remain low; once past it, throughput rises steeply. Governance decisions about tool adoption and deprecation gates impose delays (evaluation, consensus, migration) that can temporarily suppress throughput while enabling longer-run gains. Diversity in cognitive styles and backgrounds tends to increase the chance that someone finds a fit to novel tools or tasks, insulating the system against single-skill bottlenecks.

Trust and role clarity rise with repeated successful interactions, but typically require 3\u20139 months of consistent delivery. Transactive memory consolidates around module boundaries and practice communities; as knowledge of \u201cwho knows what\u201d spreads, misrouted requests decline and cross-module changes route to the right reviewers faster.

Adaptive structuration explains how participants appropriate governance tools (voting platforms, RFC processes, escalation paths); good appropriations increase fairness and throughput of decisions. A reinforcing loop operates when increased governance capacity distributes decision load, shortens policy cycle time, and improves contributor experience, which further legitimizes the process and encourages more leaders to step up.

A reinforcing loop operates when higher capacity accelerates newcomer progression and reduces review queues upstream, easing core workload and enabling further investment in mentoring. A balancing loop arises because capacity is finite and drains through time scarcity, turnover, and obsolescence of artifacts as technology shifts; without renewal, mentoring capacity decays and onboarding quality deteriorates.
