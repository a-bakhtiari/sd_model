This pool increases at a rate proportional to external visibility and social proof, with a delay of 1\u20133 months as signals propagate and reputations consolidate. Candidates convert to the periphery when the perceived task-technology fit seems achievable and self-efficacy is high; conversion speed accelerates with clear \u201cgood first issue\u201d signals, welcoming documentation, and quick response expectations. A reinforcing loop amplifies attraction: visible success and recognized leaders boost social proof, increasing inflow, which leads to more contributions that further strengthen external signals. A balancing loop tempers conversion when onboarding capacity is tight\u2014if first-response latency to newcomers\u2019 inquiries or PRs rises beyond a threshold (e.g., 7\u201310 days), negative word-of-mouth dampens the consideration inflow after a lag. Diversity-promoting cues (inclusive language, codes of conduct) widen the reachable audience and raise conversion for underrepresented groups, creating nonlinearity: below a visibility threshold, conversion remains low; above it, conversion accelerates sharply. The stock drains to the periphery through an enrollment flow and to an external sink via drop-off when expected costs exceed perceived benefits. Governance transparency (clear contribution rules, code ownership maps) lowers uncertainty, nudging a higher fraction into the periphery.

Progression to engaged newcomers occurs as individuals achieve legitimate peripheral participation through observation, shadowing, and micro-contributions. The advancement rate rises with the availability of micro-tasks, accessible communication channels, and timely feedback from mentors. A reinforcing loop emerges: as more engaged newcomers succeed, they model behavior for others, increase peer assistance, and create micro-documentation, which makes additional progression easier. A balancing loop sets in when the mentor-to-newcomer ratio falls below a viable threshold (e.g., 1:5\u20131:10): response quality and psychological safety erode, increasing peripheral attrition to the sink and reducing progression. The balance between job demands and resources shapes persistence; higher complexity and ambiguous norms increase demands, while clear templates, warm triage, and responsive reviews boost resources. Delays are prominent: it typically takes 2\u20138 weeks for a newcomer to move from passive observation to regular small contributions, and feedback delays compound when review queues lengthen. Nonlinearities appear around attention bottlenecks: once the queue of unreviewed contributions exceeds a moderate limit (e.g., 20 items), perceived neglect rises sharply, doubling attrition. Governance artifacts (codes of conduct, contributing guides, triage policies) shape legitimate participation by clarifying expectations and sanctions, reducing uncertainty and accelerating transition. The process transforms peripheral participants into engaged newcomers, limited by mentoring capacity and attention dynamics, with strong sensitivity to queueing delays and psychosocial supports.",

As individuals complete review cycles and postmortems, they codify learning into documentation and scripts; this creates a reinforcing loop: better artifacts accelerate subsequent learning-by-doing for the next cohort, which in turn improves artifacts. A counteracting loop arises from codebase complexity: as architectural intricacy and implicit conventions grow, the marginal effort to understand dependencies increases, slowing internalization. Delays are material: meaningful internalization often takes 2\u20136 months, with recognizable step-changes after milestones such as the first 10 merged PRs or first successful release contribution. Nonlinearities surface as tacit-knowledge thresholds\u2014below a critical interaction density, learning stagnates; above it, understanding accelerates. Transactive memory cues (who knows what) crystallize as contributors ask, review, and co-edit, which reduces misrouting of questions and rework. Governance practices (required design docs, ADRs, review templates) boost externalization quality, lowering knowledge leakage and speeding convergence on shared standards.

The transition to productive contributors depends on task-technology fit: when issues match skill profiles and CI/CD, linters, and review tools are appropriated effectively, throughput per person increases. Adaptive structuration explains how contributors appropriate tools and rules-in-use; positive appropriation (e.g., pre-commit hooks, test scaffolds) reduces cognitive load, shortens cycle time, and stabilizes quality. A reinforcing loop develops when improved tooling reduces build/test friction, freeing time to invest back into further automation. A balancing loop appears with skill-biased technical change: if the toolchain modernizes (e.g., containerized builds, complex monorepos) faster than user upskilling, contributors without prior exposure slow down or stall, lowering progression rates. Nonlinear learning curves are common: below a threshold of successful end-to-end build cycles (e.g., 5\u201310), confidence and velocity remain low; once past it, throughput rises steeply. Governance decisions about tool adoption and deprecation gates impose delays (evaluation, consensus, migration) that can temporarily suppress throughput while enabling longer-run gains. Diversity in cognitive styles and backgrounds tends to increase the chance that someone finds a fit to novel tools or tasks, insulating the system against single-skill bottlenecks. This process converts knowledgeable contributors into productive contributors able to deliver sustained, quality output at shorter cadences, contingent on alignment between tasks, tools, and skills.",

A reinforcing loop strengthens routines: as more contributors are entrusted, review queues shrink and cycle time drops, which raises perceived reliability and makes further entrustment easier. A counter-loop appears when ownership becomes fragmented or over-concentrated: too many owners cause coordination overhead and conflict; too few create bottlenecks and burnout risk. Trust and role clarity rise with repeated successful interactions, but typically require 3\u20139 months of consistent delivery. Transactive memory consolidates around module boundaries and practice communities; as knowledge of \u201cwho knows what\u201d spreads, misrouted requests decline and cross-module changes route to the right reviewers faster. Routines adapt via incremental change punctuated by occasional resets (e.g., adopting a new branching model). Governance artifacts (CODEOWNERS, review SLAs, release calendars) stabilize expectations but require periodic recalibration to prevent drift. Nonlinearities are evident at the \u201cbus factor\u201d: when a module\u2019s bus factor is below 2, entrustment to new owners is prioritized; once it rises above 3, marginal returns on adding owners diminish and coordination costs grow.

Bridging structural holes by connecting subcommunities or external ecosystems multiplies influence and information access, accelerating both technical and social impact. A balancing loop arises through reputation decay and audience fatigue: when activity dips or signals are crowded by many loud voices, recognition growth slows; over-claiming or low-quality visibility can even erode standing. Nonlinear threshold effects are common: visibility may remain low until a notable event (major release, keynote) crosses a salience threshold, after which recognition accelerates.

Adaptive structuration explains how participants appropriate governance tools (voting platforms, RFC processes, escalation paths); good appropriations increase fairness and throughput of decisions. A reinforcing loop operates when increased governance capacity distributes decision load, shortens policy cycle time, and improves contributor experience, which further legitimizes the process and encourages more leaders to step up. A balancing loop reflects coordination overhead: as the number of decision-makers rises beyond a quorum-efficient zone, consensus costs and policy contention grow, slowing decisions and dampening the rate of new appointments. Panarchy dynamics matter: local module councils and project-wide bodies must align; misalignment induces delays and policy resistance. Clear membership criteria, transparent monitoring, graduated sanctions, and accessible conflict resolution improve perceived legitimacy, reducing turnover and speeding accession.

A balancing loop can trigger burnout: during punctuated periods (feature freezes, security incidents), demands spike, sleep debt accumulates, and recovery lags; if average demand exceeds resources for several cycles, attrition increases and stabilization falls. Delays are multi-scale: recovery from intense releases may require weeks; trust in delegation takes months; automation payoffs often lag by quarters.

A reinforcing loop operates when higher capacity accelerates newcomer progression and reduces review queues upstream, easing core workload and enabling further investment in mentoring. A balancing loop arises because capacity is finite and drains through time scarcity, turnover, and obsolescence of artifacts as technology shifts; without renewal, mentoring capacity decays and onboarding quality deteriorates. Panarchy is central: capacity at module level scales to project and ecosystem levels through cross-project mentoring and foundation-run programs; shocks at higher scales (ecosystem deprecations, CVEs) can rapidly consume capacity. Coevolution appears as governance structures adapt to maintain a healthy pipeline (e.g., rotating maintainerships, emeritus policies).

    "overall_narrative": "The model organizes the career trajectory of open-source developers as an aging chain of people stocks linked by flows, with governance and capacity stocks providing critical feedback. Prospective contributors become peripheral participants as external reputation and signaling overcome uncertainty, moderated by onboarding capacity and first-response delays. Peripheral members legitimize participation through small tasks within communities of practice; progression is governed by the mentor-to-newcomer ratio and JD-R balance. Engaged newcomers convert effort into project-specific knowledge via SECI cycles and absorptive capacity, then capitalizing on task-technology fit and adaptive structuration to increase throughput. Productive contributors integrate into routines and the community\u2019s transactive memory, crossing thresholds that enable entrustment as module owners. Their sustained, visible stewardship accumulates reputation and bridging social capital, producing recognized leaders. Governance bodies (modules, project, foundation) then formalize authority, with adaptive structuration, panarchy alignment, and commons governance principles shaping appointment throughput and legitimacy. Core developers stabilize or exit based on JD-R dynamics and punctuated workloads. Finally, stable core developers convert time and tacit knowledge into mentoring and governance capacity\u2014an enabling stock that feeds back to every upstream stage, improving attraction, socialization, knowledge absorption, entrustment, governance throughput, and core sustainability. Nonlinear thresholds (review backlog, bus factor, quorum), multiscale delays (learning cycles, release cadences), and competing reinforcing/balancing loops (visibility-driven growth vs. capacity-driven limits) generate the observed dynamics of movement from periphery to core."
