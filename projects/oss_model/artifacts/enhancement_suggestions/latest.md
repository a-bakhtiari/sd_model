## HIGH PRIORITY

### 1. Add Trust Stock and Flows
**Category:** add_variable | **Theory:** Social Identity Theory, Communities of Practice, Social Capital Theory

**Why:** Addresses user's specific question about trust dynamics and peer feedback about weak social dynamics. Trust is a critical factor in developer progression that accumulates through positive interactions and erodes through negative experiences.

**What to do:**
- action: Add stock 'Trust Level' in Process 2 with inflow 'Trust Building Rate' (driven by 'Positive Interactions' and 'Successful Contributions') and outflow 'Trust Erosion Rate' (driven by 'Negative Interactions' and 'Rejection Rate'). Connect to 'Community Belonging' and 'Promotion Rate'.

---

### 2. Repurpose Reputation as Calculated Auxiliary
**Category:** modify_variable | **Theory:** Signaling Theory, Status Characteristics Theory

**Why:** Addresses user's question about reputation representation. Reputation should reflect current contributions and community standing rather than accumulate indefinitely. This better represents how reputation works in OSS communities.

**What to do:**
- action: Convert 'Project Reputation' stock to auxiliary 'Current Reputation Score' calculated from weighted combination of 'Recent Contributions', 'Code Quality', and 'Community Recognition'. Remove accumulation flows.

---

### 3. Add Skill-Trust Reinforcement Loop
**Category:** add_feedback_loop | **Theory:** Social Cognitive Career Theory, Communities of Practice, Self-Determination Theory

**Why:** Addresses user's question about missing feedback loops between skill development and community participation. Skills and trust mutually reinforce each other - higher skills lead to better contributions that build trust, while higher trust provides more opportunities for skill development.

**What to do:**
- action: Create reinforcing loop: Skill Level → Contribution Quality → Trust Building Rate → Access to Challenging Tasks → Skill Development Rate → Skill Level

---

## MEDIUM PRIORITY

### 4. Add Identity Formation Stock
**Category:** add_variable | **Theory:** Social Identity Theory, Self-Determination Theory

**Why:** Addresses peer feedback about identity formation and strengthens social dynamics. Developer identity evolves from newcomer to core member and influences motivation and participation.

**What to do:**
- action: Add stock 'Developer Identity Strength' with inflow 'Identity Building Rate' (driven by 'Community Acceptance' and 'Meaningful Contributions') and outflow 'Identity Erosion Rate' (driven by 'Burnout' and 'Negative Feedback'). Connect to 'Motivation Level' and 'Retention Rate'.

---

### 5. Connect Knowledge Transfer to Trust Building
**Category:** add_connection | **Theory:** Communities of Practice, Social Capital Theory, Nonaka's SECI Model

**Why:** Strengthens the relationship between knowledge sharing and social dynamics. Mentorship and knowledge transfer are key trust-building mechanisms in OSS communities.

**What to do:**
- action: Add connection from 'Implicit Knowledge Transfer (Mentorship)' to 'Trust Building Rate' with positive effect. Also connect 'Explicit Knowledge Transfer' to 'Trust Building Rate'.

---

### 6. Reorganize Social Dynamics Subsystem
**Category:** structural_change | **Theory:** Social Identity Theory, Social Capital Theory, Communities of Practice

**Why:** Addresses peer feedback about weak social dynamics by creating a dedicated subsystem for social factors that interact with technical progression.

**What to do:**
- action: Create Social Dynamics subsystem with stocks: 'Trust Level', 'Developer Identity Strength', 'Social Capital', and 'Community Cohesion'. Connect this subsystem to existing technical progression variables through bidirectional relationships.

---

### 8. Apply Hidden Order Adaptation Mechanisms
**Category:** theory_recommendation | **Theory:** Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity

**Why:** The model could better represent how complex community behaviors emerge from simple interactions. This theory helps explain self-organization in OSS communities.

**What to do:**
- action: Apply complex adaptive systems principles by adding emergent properties like 'Community Norms Emergence' and 'Self-Organization Capacity' that arise from simple interaction rules between developers.

---

### 10. Add Identity-Contribution Balancing Loop
**Category:** add_feedback_loop | **Theory:** Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Model, Self-Determination Theory

**Why:** Creates important balancing dynamic where strong identity can lead to over-commitment and burnout, which then weakens identity. This captures the sustainability challenge in OSS.

**What to do:**
- action: Create balancing loop: Developer Identity Strength → Contribution Intensity → Burnout Rate → Identity Erosion Rate → Developer Identity Strength

---

## LOW PRIORITY

### 7. Add Social Recognition Auxiliary
**Category:** add_variable | **Theory:** Self-Determination Theory, Status Characteristics Theory

**Why:** Enhances social dynamics by explicitly modeling how community recognition influences motivation and progression. Recognition serves as positive reinforcement.

**What to do:**
- action: Add auxiliary 'Social Recognition' calculated from 'Peer Feedback Quality', 'Public Acknowledgments', and 'Inclusion in Decision Making'. Connect to 'Motivation Level' and 'Identity Building Rate'.

---

### 9. Connect Governance to Trust Dynamics
**Category:** add_connection | **Theory:** Institutional Theory, Self-Determination Theory

**Why:** Governance decisions impact trust levels, which isn't currently modeled. Strict governance can either build or erode trust depending on implementation.

**What to do:**
- action: Add bidirectional connections between 'Governance Gate Strictness' and 'Trust Level', mediated by 'Perceived Fairness' auxiliary. Also connect 'Onboarding Clarity and Inclusion Norms' to 'Trust Building Rate'.
