## Extraction Principles

When extracting SD elements from Step 1 narratives:

- **Be faithful to the narratives**: Extract what's actually described in the narratives from Step 1. Don't add elements that weren't mentioned.

- **Focus on core dynamics**: Prioritize the main dynamics and feedback loops described in the narratives. Don't over-complicate by adding peripheral elements.

- **Maintain connectivity**: Ensure all processes connect to each other as specified in Step 1's connections. No isolated processes.

- **Preserve multi-scale design**: The extracted SD elements should support both macro-level (main pipeline) and micro-level (internal process dynamics) understanding.
