# Your Specific Questions for Enhancement

# This file contains your questions about the current model that you want the enhancement
# system to address. Be specific about what you're uncertain about or what you want to improve.

# Example questions:
# 1. How can I better represent burnout dynamics? The current "Overload Level" auxiliary feels too simple.
# 2. Should trust be a stock that accumulates, or an auxiliary that's calculated from interactions?
# 3. The model doesn't show how documentation quality decays over time - is this missing?
# 4. Are there feedback loops I'm missing between skill development and community participation?
# 5. How should I represent the role of "small wins" in building contributor confidence?

# Your questions:

1. How can I better represent trust dynamics in the model? The current model seems to lack explicit trust-building mechanisms.

2. Should reputation be a stock that accumulates, or an auxiliary that's calculated from contributions?

3. Are there important feedback loops I'm missing between skill development and community participation?
