# Additional Context for Enhancement

# This file contains any additional context, priorities, or constraints that should guide
# the enhancement suggestions. Include what you care most about, what you want to emphasize,
# and what you want to de-emphasize.

# Example context:
# ## Research Focus:
# I'm particularly interested in the transition from Apprentice to Practicing Contributor.
# This is where most people drop out in my empirical data.

# ## Emphasis Areas:
# - The role of small wins in building confidence and self-efficacy
# - How review cycle time affects motivation and persistence
# - The importance of finding a niche/specialty within the project
# - Trust building through repeated interactions

# ## De-emphasis Areas:
# - Detailed governance mechanisms (keep high-level)
# - Fine-grained code quality metrics
# - Economic incentives (focus on intrinsic motivation)

# ## Constraints:
# - Model should stay under 100 variables for simulation performance
# - Prefer parsimonious representation over comprehensive detail
# - Must be testable with available data (survey + GitHub activity logs)

# ## Data Availability:
# I have:
# - GitHub contribution data (commits, PRs, reviews, issues)
# - Survey data on newcomer experiences (N=150)
# - Interview data from 20 maintainers
# I don't have:
# - Detailed code quality metrics over time
# - Direct measures of psychological variables (trust, identity)

# Your context:
