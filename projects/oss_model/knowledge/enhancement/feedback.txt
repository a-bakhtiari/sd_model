# - Trust dynamics seem weak - need more explicit representation of trust building
# - Missing connection between reputation and mentoring capacity
# - Consider adding identity formation as a stock, not just an auxiliary

# ## Peer Review (Jane Doe, 2025-10-18):
# - Technical debt representation is good but doesn't show impact on newcomer learning
# - Need clearer distinction between peripheral and core participation
# - The transition from Apprentice to Practicing Contributor needs more detail

# ## Conference Presentation Feedback (2025-09-20):
# - Audience asked about the role of project size/maturity in progression dynamics
# - Reviewer suggested considering organizational context more explicitly

# Your feedback:
