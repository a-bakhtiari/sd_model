They begin at the periphery, learning through legitimate peripheral participation by observing workflows and absorbing tacit knowledge through informal interactions. This process involves shadowing experienced members and absorbing the community's culture and practices through shared activities and storytelling. The rate of engagement depends on both the newcomers' motivation and the community's openness to including peripheral participants.",

    "overall_narrative": "The knowledge creation spiral begins with newcomers entering through peripheral engagement [Process 1] where they absorb tacit knowledge through socialization. As they gain understanding [overlap: Process 1\u21922], members move toward core participation and begin articulating their learning through externalization. This externalized knowledge [overlap: Process 2\u21923] flows into systematic combination where the community refines practices and creates shared frameworks. Systematized knowledge [overlap: Process 3\u21924] then enables deep internalization where members transform explicit knowledge into personal competence and stronger community identity. The internalized expertise [feedback loop: Process 4\u21922] enhances members' ability to mentor newcomers and articulate knowledge, creating a continuous spiral of knowledge creation and community development. Throughout this process, refined practices [feedback: Process 3\u21921] inform what peripheral members learn, while core integration [connection: Process 2\u21924] enables the identity formation that sustains community participation over time."
