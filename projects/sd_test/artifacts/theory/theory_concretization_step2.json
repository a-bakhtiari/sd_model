        "narrative": "Explicit knowledge from combination processes is absorbed, practiced, and transformed into individual tacit knowledge and capabilities. Organizational members learn through doing, applying combined knowledge in real work situations, and developing personal mastery. This learning-by-doing process creates new skills, intuitions, and practical know-how that become part of individual competence. As knowledge is internalized, it creates the foundation for new cycles of socialization.",

    "overall_narrative": "The knowledge creation system operates as an integrated spiral where knowledge continuously transforms through interconnected processes. Knowledge Socialization [Process 1] creates the foundational tacit understanding through shared experiences, feeding into Knowledge Externalization [overlap: Process 1\u21922] where implicit knowledge is articulated into explicit forms. These articulated concepts flow into Knowledge Combination [overlap: Process 2\u21923] where they are systematically organized into comprehensive knowledge systems. The organized knowledge then moves to Knowledge Internalization [overlap: Process 3\u21924] where it is absorbed through practice and transformed back into new tacit capabilities. This newly developed tacit knowledge completes the cycle by flowing back into Knowledge Socialization [feedback: Process 4\u21921], creating an upward knowledge spiral. Throughout this entire flow, Community Development [Process 5] provides the essential social context that enables all knowledge processes, with bidirectional feedback loops connecting it to every other process. The community's development both enables and is strengthened by each knowledge transformation, while individual movement from peripheral to core participation [connection: Process 5\u2192all] drives the entire system's capacity for knowledge creation and sharing."
