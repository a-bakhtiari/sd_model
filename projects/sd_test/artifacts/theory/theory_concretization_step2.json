This foundation of tacit knowledge flows into Knowledge Externalization [overlap: Process 1\u21922] where participants articulate their understanding and move toward more central participation. The articulated explicit knowledge then enters Knowledge Combination [overlap: Process 2\u21923] where it is systematically organized and integrated into coherent knowledge systems. These organized systems flow into Knowledge Internalization [overlap: Process 3\u21924] where knowledge is applied, embodied, and transformed back into new tacit understanding. Throughout this spiral, Community Core Development [Process 5] provides the social context that shapes participation patterns and maintains community standards. Critical feedback loops connect later processes to earlier ones: new insights from internalization [feedback: Process 4\u21921] enrich socialization, while community identity [connections: Process 5\u21922,3] influences how knowledge is articulated and combined. This creates a continuous knowledge spiral where each process feeds into and enriches the others, with community development serving as the stabilizing force that enables sustained knowledge creation and sharing."
