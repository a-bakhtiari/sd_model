    "overall_narrative": "The knowledge creation system operates as an integrated spiral where knowledge continuously transforms through interconnected processes. Knowledge Socialization [Process 1] introduces newcomers to community practices, creating tacit understanding that flows into Knowledge Externalization [overlap: Process 1\u21922] where implicit knowledge is articulated. Externalized explicit knowledge then moves to Knowledge Combination [overlap: Process 2\u21923] where it is systematically integrated with existing knowledge. The combined knowledge flows into Knowledge Internalization [overlap: Process 3\u21924] where it is learned and applied, creating new tacit knowledge that feeds back into the socialization process [feedback loop: Process 4\u21921]. Throughout this spiral, Community Core Development [Process 5] provides the social structure that enables knowledge flow, with members progressing from periphery to core [connection: Process 1\u21925] and core members driving knowledge processes [feedback: Process 5\u21922, Process 5\u21923]. The system creates reinforcing cycles where knowledge application generates new knowledge, and community development strengthens knowledge processes, forming a continuous knowledge creation spiral that builds organizational capability over time."
