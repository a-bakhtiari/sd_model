    "overall_narrative": "The knowledge creation and community development system flows through five interconnected processes. New members enter through Knowledge Socialization & Peripheral Engagement [Process 1], where they absorb foundational understanding through observation and shared experiences. As they develop, they transition to Knowledge Externalization & Core Contribution [Process 2], articulating their growing expertise and moving toward full community membership. Their articulated knowledge flows into Knowledge Combination & Community Integration [Process 3], where individual contributions become organized into the community's shared knowledge base. This organized knowledge then feeds into Knowledge Internalization & Practice Refinement [Process 4], where members apply and master the knowledge through practice, developing deep expertise. The refined practices and expertise from this internalization process contribute to Community Evolution & Boundary Management [Process 5], where the community adapts and redefines itself. Critical feedback loops connect these processes: practice insights from internalization [Process 4] inform new knowledge articulation in externalization [Process 2], community evolution [Process 5] influences how knowledge is organized [Process 3], and evolving community standards affect socialization practices [Process 1]. This creates a continuous knowledge spiral where individual learning fuels community development, and community evolution enables deeper individual mastery."
