        "narrative": "A pool of peripheral members accumulates when newcomers join at a rate influenced by community visibility and reputation signals. These newcomers build up observational experience through legitimate peripheral participation, with the pace of experience accumulation determined by community openness and interaction frequency (typically 2-4 meaningful interactions per week). The socialization process occurs as members absorb tacit knowledge through shared practice, with knowledge transfer effectiveness varying with trust levels and interaction quality. Members progress toward more central participation at a rate limited by available mentoring capacity and individual learning readiness. Reinforcing feedback: As more members achieve core status, mentoring capacity increases, accelerating newcomer progression and creating more future mentors. Nonlinear threshold: Progress accelerates sharply after members accumulate 8-12 successful practice experiences, but slows when mentor-to-newcomer ratio exceeds 1:7. Time delay: The transition from peripheral to active participation typically takes 4-8 months depending on community engagement patterns.",

        "narrative": "Tacit knowledge accumulates through shared experiences and practice interactions, with the rate of knowledge generation driven by collaboration frequency and problem complexity. The externalization process converts tacit knowledge to explicit forms at a pace limited by documentation capacity and articulation skills. A knowledge repository builds up documented insights and practices, growing at the externalization rate minus knowledge obsolescence. Combination activities integrate and refine explicit knowledge, occurring at a processing rate constrained by review capacity and synthesis capability. Reinforcing feedback: More explicit knowledge in the repository stimulates new combinations and externalizations, creating knowledge multiplication effects. Balancing feedback: As the knowledge base grows, maintenance overhead increases, slowing the net addition rate. Nonlinearity: Knowledge creation accelerates when critical mass of 15-20 active contributors is reached, but saturates when coordination complexity exceeds available integration capacity. Time delay: Benefits of new knowledge typically appear 2-4 months after documentation as content gets validated and integrated.",

Core members build up mentoring capacity measured in available mentor-hours per week, which grows as new members reach core status and declines through attrition or reduced availability. The community's collective expertise develops through shared practice and problem-solving, with expertise accumulation rate influenced by challenge diversity and reflection practices. Workload pressure accumulates as core members take on mentoring, coordination, and knowledge creation responsibilities. Balancing feedback: When workload exceeds sustainable capacity (typically 70% of available time), burnout risk increases, leading to reduced participation and potential attrition, which further increases workload on remaining members. Reinforcing feedback: Successful mentoring builds community reputation, attracting more qualified newcomers who eventually become core members. Nonlinear threshold: Community vitality drops sharply when core membership falls below 8-10 active members due to insufficient critical mass for sustained activity. Time delay: It takes 12-18 months for new core members to develop full mentoring capability and deep community understanding.",

Application outcomes generate performance feedback that accumulates as experience data. Reinforcing feedback: Successful applications build confidence and competence, enabling more complex applications and deeper internalization. Balancing feedback: Application failures create caution and trigger knowledge refinement needs. The internalization process typically shows rapid initial progress followed by plateau periods, with full mastery requiring 6-12 months of consistent practice. Nonlinearity: Internalization accelerates when members achieve 5-7 successful applications of core concepts, but slows when application complexity exceeds current competence by more than 20%. Time delay: Performance improvements from new knowledge typically manifest 1-3 months after internalization as skills become automated.",

As they progress, successful members transition to core status, building the community's mentoring capacity and collective expertise. Throughout this journey, knowledge flows through a continuous spiral: tacit knowledge develops through shared practice, gets externalized into explicit forms, combines with existing knowledge, and becomes internalized through application. The core community drives knowledge creation and validation while supporting newcomer development. Application outcomes feed back to refine the knowledge base and inform community development priorities. This creates an integrated learning ecosystem where member development, knowledge evolution, and community growth reinforce each other through multiple interconnected feedback loops. The complete flow moves from peripheral observation through progressive participation to core contribution, with knowledge continuously cycling between tacit and explicit forms through application and refinement."
