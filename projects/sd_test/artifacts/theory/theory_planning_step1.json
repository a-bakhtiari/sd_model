    "overall_narrative": "The knowledge creation system begins with Knowledge Socialization where tacit knowledge transfers through shared experiences and peripheral participation [Process 1]. This shared understanding flows into Knowledge Externalization [overlap: Process 1\u21922] where community members articulate tacit knowledge into explicit concepts through dialogue. The articulated knowledge then moves to Knowledge Combination [overlap: Process 2\u21923] where explicit knowledge is systematically organized into coherent systems. These organized knowledge systems feed into Knowledge Internalization [overlap: Process 3\u21924] where learning-by-doing transforms explicit knowledge back into personal tacit expertise. The newly internalized knowledge creates a feedback loop [connection: Process 4\u21921] that enriches future socialization processes. Throughout this SECI spiral, Community Core Development [Process 5] enables member progression from periphery to core, with core members facilitating knowledge processes while their own expertise grows through internalization [feedback: Process 4\u21925]. Community Infrastructure [Process 6] provides the supporting structures that enable all knowledge processes, evolving through the combination of explicit knowledge [connection: Process 3\u21926] and being shaped by core member stewardship [feedback: Process 5\u21926]. This creates a dynamic knowledge ecosystem where social learning, knowledge transformation, community development, and infrastructure evolution continuously reinforce each other in a virtuous cycle of organizational learning."
