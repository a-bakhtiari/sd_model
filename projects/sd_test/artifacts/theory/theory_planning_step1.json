These explicit concepts then move to Knowledge Combination where they are systematized and integrated into the organizational knowledge repository [overlap: Process 2\u21923]. The structured knowledge from the repository flows into Knowledge Internalization where members absorb and apply it, progressing toward core membership [overlap: Process 3\u21924]. Core members from the internalization process feed back into the socialization stage [feedback loop: Process 4\u21921] as mentors, creating a reinforcing cycle. Practical experience gained during internalization also enriches the tacit knowledge base, completing the knowledge spiral. This creates a continuous flow where knowledge transforms through socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization stages, with experienced members cycling back to accelerate newcomer development."
