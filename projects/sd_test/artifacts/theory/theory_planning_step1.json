Knowledge Socialization [Process 1] creates the foundational tacit understanding through shared experiences, feeding into Knowledge Externalization [overlap: Process 1\u21922] where implicit knowledge is articulated into explicit forms. These articulated concepts flow into Knowledge Combination [overlap: Process 2\u21923] where they are systematically organized into comprehensive knowledge systems. The organized knowledge then moves to Knowledge Internalization [overlap: Process 3\u21924] where it is absorbed through practice and transformed back into new tacit capabilities. This newly developed tacit knowledge completes the cycle by flowing back into Knowledge Socialization [feedback: Process 4\u21921], creating an upward knowledge spiral. Throughout this entire flow, Community Development [Process 5] provides the essential social context that enables all knowledge processes, with bidirectional feedback loops connecting it to every other process. The community's development both enables and is strengthened by each knowledge transformation, while individual movement from peripheral to core participation [connection: Process 5\u2192all] drives the entire system's capacity for knowledge creation and sharing."
