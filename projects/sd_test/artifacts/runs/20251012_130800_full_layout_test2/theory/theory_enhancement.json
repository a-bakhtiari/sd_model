However, Wenger\u2019s theory emphasizes legitimate peripheral participation and identity/belonging, which are not yet operationalized as entry and retention dynamics. Adding onboarding, peripheral access quality, mentor capacity constraints, and a belonging-based attrition mechanism makes participation and movement from periphery to core explicit and testable. This improves behavioral realism by introducing capacity limits and dropout loops that shape community sustainability.",
