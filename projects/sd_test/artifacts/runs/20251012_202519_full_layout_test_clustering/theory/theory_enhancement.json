As they progress, these contributors engage in Mentorship and Social Learning, receiving tacit knowledge from experienced members that complements the explicit documentation. Successful skill development and community integration through these processes enables Contribution Progression, where members advance to more responsible roles. The knowledge gained by advancing contributors feeds back into the Knowledge Codification process, creating a virtuous cycle of knowledge preservation and renewal. Community Renewal and Turnover naturally occurs as core developers transition out, creating advancement opportunities that motivate the progression pathway. This creates an interconnected system where knowledge flows bidirectionally between explicit documentation and tacit social learning, while community members progress along a development pathway that both depends on and contributes to the community's knowledge ecosystem."
