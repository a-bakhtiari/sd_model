As skills develop [Process 3], contributors move into Contribution Integration [overlap: Process 3\u21924] where their work becomes part of community projects. Successful integration leads to Role Transition & Leadership Development [overlap: Process 4\u21925] where contributors become core members. The system features multiple feedback loops: newly developed leaders [feedback: Process 5\u21921] contribute back to knowledge codification, mentorship effectiveness [connection: Process 3\u21922] influences socialization success, and integration experiences [feedback: Process 4\u21923] inform skill development approaches.
