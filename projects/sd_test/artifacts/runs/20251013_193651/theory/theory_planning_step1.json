        "narrative": "Accumulations: (1) The pool of peripheral contributors grows when newcomers complete first issues and shrinks via early attrition; (2) The shared knowledge base (guides, patterns, FAQs) accumulates as tacit know-how is externalized and erodes when it becomes stale; (3) Trust and initial reputation build through repeated, constructive review interactions. Rates and speeds: Newcomers transition into active periphery at a rate driven by available mentors and documentation clarity; knowledge externalization occurs at a writing pace constrained by reviewer/editor attention; attrition from the periphery rises when review latency is high; trust grows slowly per interaction and quickens with higher feedback frequency. Feedback loops: Reinforcing\u2014richer knowledge base and helpful peer exchanges reduce onboarding effort, which increases successful first contributions that further enrich the knowledge base. Balancing\u2014mentor overload (mentor-to-newcomer ratio above ~1:5) slows onboarding, increasing wait times and attrition, which eventually relieves pressure. Time delays: First-PR cycle typically takes 2\u20136 weeks; reliable trust for meaningful responsibilities forms over 3\u201312 months. Nonlinearities: After ~10 meaningful interactions (code reviews, chats, small fixes), confidence and trust accelerate; onboarding effectiveness saturates when documentation coverage is high and additional pages add little. Causal drivers: Onboarding speed is limited by mentor bandwidth, review responsiveness, and the accessibility of explicit practices; time zone dispersion and language barriers increase communication delays; clearer contribution templates reduce the need for synchronous mentorship.",

Rates and speeds: Submission rate depends on active periphery size and perceived responsiveness; review throughput depends on maintainer bandwidth and automation; acceptance rate rises with test quality and guideline adherence; promotion rate is gated by reputation crossing thresholds and availability of maintainers to sponsor. Feedback loops: Reinforcing\u2014accepted contributions raise reputation, which grants more decision rights and access, enabling higher-impact contributions that are more likely to be accepted. Balancing\u2014when review backlog grows, review latency lengthens (1\u20132 weeks typical), lowering contributor satisfaction and new submissions, which gradually reduces backlog. Time delays: Earning enough reputation for elevated permissions takes 2\u20134 months of consistent contributions; promotions to core typically occur after 3\u201312 months. Nonlinearities: Promotion often occurs once a reputation threshold is crossed (step change in access); repeated very small PRs yield diminishing reputation gains beyond ~5\u201310 trivial fixes; severe backlog spikes cause abrupt drops in submission rate as perceived responsiveness falls. Causal drivers: Throughput is constrained by the number of active reviewers, the share of changes covered by automated checks, and code ownership boundaries; clear, codified contribution pathways increase acceptance probability and reduce rework.",

Reinforcing\u2014clearer rules reduce coordination failures, freeing maintainer bandwidth to further improve processes, accelerating maturity. Time delays: Policy proposals to adoption take 1\u20133 months; reviewer assignment typically within days; cultural adoption of new norms lags formal rule change by weeks. Nonlinearities: Decision quorums create thresholds where below-minimum participation stalls changes; over-centralization (few gatekeepers) raises gatekeeping risk and increases contributor attrition; a bus factor below ~2 on critical modules sharply increases incident and delay risk.

Rates and speeds: Vulnerabilities are discovered at a rate tied to code size, dependency exposure, and audit intensity; patching rate depends on available maintainers and triage effectiveness; test coverage grows at a pace limited by contributor skill and CI stability; debt repayment is constrained by allocated time.

Quality, Security, and Resilience Management closes the loop by gating merges with automated checks and tests, managing the vulnerability backlog, and freeing capacity through automation improvements; these signals accelerate or slow acceptance and feed back into documentation that supports newcomers.
