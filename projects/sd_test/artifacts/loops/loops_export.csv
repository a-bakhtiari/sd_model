R01,reinforcing,Core Developer -> Implicit Knowledge Transfer (Mentorship) -> Promotion Rate -> Core Developer,"This reinforcing loop accelerates team growth as more core developers provide mentorship, increasing the promotion rate and further expanding the core team.",Socialization in Open Source Software Projects: A Growth Mixture Modeling Approach,"Qureshi, I., Fang, Y.",2011,Examines how socialization processes in OSS projects lead to role transitions and team growth through mentorship,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cff20e5cc73fb98bdb86cf6cabc7818f16de7211,cff20e5cc73fb98bdb86cf6cabc7818f16de7211,126,,,Sociology
R02,reinforcing,Core Developer -> Implicit Knowledge Transfer (Mentorship) -> Skill up -> Experienced Contributors -> Promotion Rate -> Core Developer,"This virtuous cycle amplifies team capability as mentorship builds experienced contributors who get promoted, creating more mentors to continue the skill-building process.",,,,,,,,,,
R03,reinforcing,New Contributors -> Skill up -> Experienced Contributors -> Promotion Rate -> Core Developer -> Implicit Knowledge Transfer (Mentorship) -> New Contributors,"This reinforcing loop expands the contributor pipeline as new members gain skills and get promoted, eventually becoming mentors who accelerate skill development for others.",,,,,,,,,,
B01,balancing,Core Developer -> Developer's Turnover -> Core Developer,This balancing loop stabilizes team size by limiting core developer growth as natural turnover creates vacancies that must be filled through promotion.,,,,,,,,,,
B02,balancing,Core Developer -> Implicit Knowledge Transfer (Mentorship) -> Skill up -> Experienced Contributors -> Promotion Rate -> Core Developer,This balancing loop creates equilibrium in team composition by ensuring the promotion rate from experienced contributors matches the capacity for effective mentorship from core developers.,,,,,,,,,,
