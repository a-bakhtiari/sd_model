R01,reinforcing,Core Developer -> Implicit Knowledge Transfer (Mentorship) -> Promotion Rate -> Core Developer,"More core developers increase mentorship, accelerating the promotion of new core developers. This reinforcing loop creates exponential growth in the core team's size and capacity.",Socialization in Open Source Software Projects: A Growth Mixture Modeling Approach,"Qureshi, I., Fang, Y.",2011,Examines how socialization processes including mentorship lead to core developer status in OSS projects,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/cff20e5cc73fb98bdb86cf6cabc7818f16de7211,cff20e5cc73fb98bdb86cf6cabc7818f16de7211,126,,,Sociology
R02,reinforcing,Core Developer -> Implicit Knowledge Transfer (Mentorship) -> Skill up -> Experienced Contributors -> Promotion Rate -> Core Developer,"Core developers mentor others, increasing the skilled contributor pool and accelerating promotions. This reinforcing loop amplifies the project's overall experience and development velocity over time.",Knowledge Collaboration in Online Communities,"Faraj, S., Jarvenpaa, S. L., et al.",2011,Documents how knowledge transfer through mentoring increases collective capability and project velocity,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc7e13b992329bcfaea9142695d5bb06de596703,bc7e13b992329bcfaea9142695d5bb06de596703,989,,Organ. Sci.,Computer Science; Sociology
B01,balancing,Experienced Contributors -> Promotion Rate -> Experienced Contributors,"A higher promotion rate depletes the pool of experienced contributors, which in turn slows the promotion rate. This balancing loop seeks equilibrium in the contributor hierarchy.",The Cathedral and the Bazaar,"Raymond, E. S.",1999,Describes the natural hierarchy and promotion dynamics in OSS projects where core developers emerge from contributors,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5eaf9f92564b1ba8060c5d1021f8cfd70ae6b36b,5eaf9f92564b1ba8060c5d1021f8cfd70ae6b36b,3574,,First Monday,Computer Science; Engineering
B02,balancing,New Contributors -> Skill up -> New Contributors,"As new contributors gain skills, they leave the 'new' pool, slowing the overall skill-up rate. This balancing loop regulates the growth of inexperienced contributors.",,,,,,,,,,
B03,balancing,Core Developer -> Developer's Turnover -> Core Developer,"An increase in core developers leads to higher turnover, which then reduces the number of core developers. This balancing loop stabilizes the core team size against attrition.",,,,,,,,,,
