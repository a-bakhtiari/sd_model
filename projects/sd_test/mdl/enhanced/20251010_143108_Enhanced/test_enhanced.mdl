Communities of Practice (Wenger): The current model captures movement from periphery to core but lacks key CoP concepts like legitimate peripheral participation and boundary processes. Adding these elements will better represent how newcomers become integrated into the community through meaningful participation and how community boundaries affect knowledge flow and identity formation.

Nonaka's SECI Model: The current model has implicit and explicit knowledge transfer but doesn't capture the full SECI knowledge spiral. Adding socialization spaces and knowledge internalization processes will complete the cycle, showing how tacit knowledge becomes explicit and gets re-internalized, creating a continuous knowledge creation loop essential for organizational learning.
