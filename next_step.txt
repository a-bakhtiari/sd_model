I need this dataframe to have the from and to variable names, from and to variable types, the negative or positive impact (if available). 


I want a feature in a seperate dataframe where potential connections between all variables are investigated. potential loops, missing elements to create a loops
missing logic in the model based on theories


I want a feature where potential fundemantal logic of the diagram, it's components, can be developed, quesitoned, discussed, etc.


I need to add a theory and context file with purpose and everything for the llm

I may need to give the llm an example of what a given row means if I am going to process row by row (unlikely, llms can process much more). I can likely
give it the entire thing with a focus on one element. but again this could be confusing for the llm and I may need to break it down further.

I may need to consult claude to see which format is better for me to give the item to the llm. I context could be produced by the llm too.

it should be aware 




I understand exactly what you're aiming for - a comprehensive system dynamics analysis and improvement tool. Your end goal is an intelligent assistant that can:

Analyze/Critique - Look at each connection and say "Does this make sense? Is it supported by literature?"
Theory-driven improvements - Take organizational theory, software engineering research, etc. and suggest "Based on Conway's Law, you should add a connection between X and Y"
Find missing elements - "Your model lacks trust decay mechanisms that research shows are important"
Validate against data - "This relationship should be negative based on empirical studies"

Here's where I'd place these in your pipeline:
Phase 1: Structure Extraction (What you have now)

Step 1: LLM parses MDL â†’ connections.json
Step 2: Graph algorithms find loops
Step 3: LLM classifies loops (R/B)

Phase 2: Deep Analysis (Your end goal)

Step 4: LLM + Literature Review

Input: connections.json + research papers/theories
Output: Critique of each connection with citations


Step 5: LLM + Theory Application

Input: Model structure + specific theories (e.g., "Apply Brooks' Law")
Output: Suggested new variables/connections


Step 6: Model Expansion

Input: Current model + domain knowledge base
Output: "You're missing: technical debt, burnout rates, documentation decay..."



Phase 3: Iterative Refinement

Step 7: Test proposed changes in simulation
Step 8: LLM evaluates if behavior matches theory
Loop back to Step 5

The key is building up a knowledge base the LLM can reference - theories about open source, organizational dynamics, software engineering principles. Then each component gets evaluated against this knowledge.
Is this the kind of analytical depth you're envisioning?
