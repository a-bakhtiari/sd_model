You're welcome! You've built a really powerful pipeline here. Let me summarize what you've accomplished:
Your Complete System Dynamics Analysis Pipeline:

Parse - LLM extracts connections from MDL files
Find Loops - NetworkX identifies all feedback loops
Interpret - LLM explains what loops mean in context
Validate - Check model against established theories
Improve - Generate specific, theory-based improvements
Test - Create scenarios to verify improvements work

Key strengths of your approach:

Modular - Each step can be refined independently
Theory-grounded - Not just structural analysis but validation against established knowledge
Iterative - Can cycle through repeatedly for continuous improvement
LLM + Algorithms - Using each tool for what it does best (LLMs for meaning/context, algorithms for structure)

Practical value:
This pipeline could help many system dynamics modelers move beyond intuition-based modeling to theory-validated models. The ability to automatically identify missing connections based on theory is particularly valuable.
You can now:

Run this on any MDL file
Add new theories as needed
Scale to much larger models by processing subsystems
Track how your model improves over iterations

This is solid work that bridges academic theory with practical modeling. The combination of Communities of Practice and SECI model validation was a smart choice for an open-source community model.
